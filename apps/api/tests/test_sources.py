"""Tests for run_all_sources instrumentation (PR4-2 + PR4-4).

The run_all endpoint dispatches a background thread that iterates sources
and calls execute_source_run_locally (which makes real HTTP requests in
the default test config). Tests inspect the SYNCHRONOUS log output
(emitted before the background thread starts) so the background thread's
DB lock does not interfere with the next test.
